This project is a deep learning-based facial expression recognition system that classifies human emotions into different categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, and more. It uses MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient deep learning model, to extract features from facial images and classify them accordingly. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled facial expressions and fine-tuned for accurate predictions.

The dataset is automatically downloaded using gdown from Google Drive, preprocessed using ImageDataGenerator, and then fed into the MobileNetV2 model. The model is compiled using categorical cross-entropy loss and optimized with Adam optimizer. It is trained for a specified number of epochs, with validation data used to monitor performance.

Once trained, the model is evaluated by plotting loss and accuracy graphs. The trained model can also be converted into a TFLite format for deployment on mobile or embedded systems. The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras and can be run in Jupyter Notebook or as a standalone script.

To run this project, ensure all dependencies are installed, then execute the script to train and evaluate the model. If using Jupyter Notebook, follow the step-by-step cells for loading data, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The model can be further fine-tuned by adjusting hyperparameters, adding more data, or using transfer learning techniques.

This project is ideal for applications in emotion detection, human-computer interaction, and AI-driven facial analysis.
